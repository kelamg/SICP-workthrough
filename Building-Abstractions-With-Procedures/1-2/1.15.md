> (a) `p` is applied 5 times upon evaluation.
> (b) The order of growth is the same for both the space and time complexity because the number of steps required at each iteration is invariant and the space is fixed as a result of each recursive call of `p`. At each step, `a` is divided by 3 which means that the number of steps vary logarithmically with `a`, so the order of growth is `O(log a)`.

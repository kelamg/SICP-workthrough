###### Applicative-order
Running `(test 0 (p))` causes an infinite loop in the interpreter. This happens because `(p)` gets evaluated before entering the body of `test` causing the non-terminating definition of `(p)` to begin execution.

###### Normal-order
Since the operands are initially evaluated in normal-order evaluation, the second argument is never evaluated and the function returns 0.

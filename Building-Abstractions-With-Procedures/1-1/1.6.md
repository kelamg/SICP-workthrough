`new-if` uses applicative-order evaluation. This means that every argument passed to it is first expanded and evaluated before its function body begins evaluation. Since the `else-clause` expression is a recursive expression which will always gets evaluated due to the applicative-order evaluation, the function will infinitely recurse on itself. This does not happen with `if` because it is a special form which evaluates the final expression if and only if the predicate expression returns false.
